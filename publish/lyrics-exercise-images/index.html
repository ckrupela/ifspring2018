		<p class="chorus"> Together, together, together everyone<br>
		Together, together, come on, let's have some fun<br>
		Together, we're there for each other every time<br>
		Together, together come on, let's do this right<br></p>

		<p class="name">[Troy]</p>
		<p> I finally figured out <span style="font-weight: 300">(yeah yeah)</span><br>
		That all our dreams have no limitations<br>
		That's what it's all about <span style="font-weight: 300">(come on now)</span></p>

		<p class="name">[Gabriella]</p>
		<p> Everyone is special in their own way<br>
		We make each other strong <span style="font-weight: 300">(each other strong)</span><br>
		We're not the same<br>
		We're different in a good way<br>
		Together's where we belong</p>

		<p class="all">[All]</p>
		<p class="chorus"> We're all in this together<br>
		Once we know, that we are<br>
		We're all stars<br>
		And we see that<br>
		We're all in this together<br>
		And it shows, when we stand<br>
		Hand in hand<br>
		Make our dreams come true</p>
		 

		<p class="chorus" >(Everybody now)</p>

		Know inside<br>
		We can make it<br>
		We're all in this together <span style="font-weight: 300">(everyone)</span><br>
		Once we see, there's a chance<br>
		That we have<br>
		And we take it</p>

		<p class="breakdown">Wildcats, sing along<br>
		Yeah, you really got it going on<br>
		Wildcats in the house<br>
		Everybody say it now<br>

		Wave your hands up in the air<br>
		That's the way we do it<br>
		Let's get to it<br>
		Time to show the world</p>
