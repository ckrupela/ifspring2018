		<h1>Introductory Questions</h1>
		<h2> Claire Krupela </h2>
		<p>1: My name is Claire Krupela, I am a junior majoring in Economics and Strategy with minors in Comuter Science and Design<br><hr>
		2: Having minors in both Design and Computer Science, when I saw this class I knew I had to take it. I am very interested in UI/UX and creating interesting and encapsulating consumer experiences. I don't have much web dev experience, so I thought this would be a nice intro before taking more technical base computer science classes in this area.<br><hr>
		3: Not really. One time I had to figure out some basic HTML to create an extension page for the computer science class I was in, but that is it.<br><hr>
		4: I hope to learn how to create visually stunning websites through coding. By the end of this class, I want to be able to create a personal website to act as a portfolio/resume to show people who want to learn more about me and what I do. <br><hr>
		5: One major thing that I think is different about designing for screen vs for paper is the user interaction part of it. On paper the user interaction is physical, whereas on the screen is is more based in how the page reacts to clicks or scrolls.<br><hr>
		6: <a href="http://pgavdestinations.com/"> PGAV Destinations</a>: PGAV Destinations has a website that exemplifies effective design for many reasons. One of these reasons is how they use the entrance to their website to show visitors what they do and how they create experiences through design. Their website shows its visitors what they do as a company, it truly is an extension of their work. Instead of being a way to simply display what they have done, they use it to show how they do things. They are an exhibit/theme park/experience design company--their website shows this in how they display many pictures in a way that guides the eye and allows the users to learn more about them through their journey through the website. They also feature diagrams throughout that show the many aspects of their processes.<br><hr>
		7: <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_University_in_St._Louis"> Wikipedia</a>: Even thought Wikipedia isn't a <em>pretty</em> website, I do think it is extremely effective in communicating. It has created a standard way of showing information based off of sections and features pictures to help illustrate points when it can. By sectioning off information into smaller snippets it makes for easy reading and understanding. One of the other high points for their website is how they provide links to other pages and sources so that the reader can find as much information as they want.<br><hr>
		8: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a>: I think LinkedIn is a great example of a website that works well because it is not un-attractive to the eye and provides information in clear and conise ways. There are distinct areas of the website meant for different things and this creates for an easy overall experience with the site. LinkedIn is also effective because it knows its target user, and knows how to cater to them in their design. An example of this is how they have the number and types of views your profile gets promptly displayed so that you know who is finding you on the website and how they are finding you. Users can then use this information to tailor their profile to those who they want views from.</p>
