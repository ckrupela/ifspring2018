		<p><strong>[All]</strong><br>
		Together, together, together everyone<br>
		Together, together, come on, let's have some fun<br>
		Together, we're there for each other every time<br>
		Together, together come on, let's do this right<br></p>

		<p><strong>[Troy]</strong><br>
		I finally figured out <em>(yeah yeah)</em><br>
		That all our dreams have no limitations<br>
		That's what it's all about <em>(come on now)</em></p>

		<p><strong>[Gabriella]</strong><br>
		Everyone is special in their own way<br>
		We make each other strong <em>(each other strong)</em><br>
		We're not the same<br>
		We're different in a good way<br>
		Together's where we belong</p>

		<p><strong>[All]</strong><br>
		We're all in this together<br>
		Once we know, that we are<br>
		We're all stars<br>
		And we see that<br>
		We're all in this together<br>
		And it shows, when we stand<br>
		Hand in hand<br>
		Make our dreams come true</p>
		 

<p>(Everybody now)<br>
Together, together, together everyone<br>
Together, together, come on, let's have some fun<br>
Together, we're there for each other every time<br>
Together, together, come on, let's do this right<br></p>

<p><strong>[Ryan]</strong><br>
We're all here <em>(yeah)</em><br>
And speaking out in one voice<br>
We're going to rock the house <em>(rock the house)</em><br>
The party's on now <em>(oh)</em>, everybody make some noise<br>
Come on, scream and shout</p>

<p><strong>[Sharpay]</strong><br>
We've arrived because we stuck together<br>
Champions one and all</p>

<p><strong>[All]</strong><br>
We're all in this together <em>(together)</em><br>
Once we know, that we are <em>(that we are)</em><br>
We're all stars<br>
And we see that<br>
We're all in this together <em>(oh)</em><br>
And it shows, when we stand<br>
Hand in hand<br>
Make our dreams come</p>
 

<p>We're all in this together (together)<br>
When we reach, we can fly<br>
Know inside<br>
We can make it<br>
We're all in this together (everyone)<br>
Once we see, there's a chance<br>
That we have<br>
And we take it</p>

<p>Wildcats, sing along<br>
Yeah, you really got it going on<br>
Wildcats in the house<br>
Everybody say it now<br>
Wildcats, everywhere<br>
Wave your hands up in the air<br>
That's the way we do it<br>
Let's get to it<br>
Time to show the world</p>

<p>We're all in this together <em>(oh)</em><br>
Once we know, that we are <em>(that we are)</em><br>
We're all stars<br>
And we see that<br>
We're all in this together <em>(together)</em><br>
And it shows, when we stand<br>
Hand in hand<br>
Make our dreams come</p>
